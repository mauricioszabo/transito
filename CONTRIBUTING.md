## Contributing

This library is open source, developed internally by Cognitect. We welcome discussions of potential problems and enhancement suggestions on the [transit-format mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/transit-format). Issues can be filed using GitHub [issues](https://github.com/cognitect/transito-ruby/issues) for this project. Because transito is incorporated into products and client projects, we prefer to do development internally and are not accepting pull requests or patches.
