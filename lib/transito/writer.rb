module Transit
  # Transit::Writer marshals Ruby objects as transito values to an output stream.
  # @see https://github.com/cognitect/transito-format
  class Writer

    # @param [Symbol] format required :json, :json_verbose, or :msgpack
    # @param [IO]     io required
    # @param [Hash]   opts optional

    # <tt>format</tt> (<tt>:json</tt>, <tt>:json_verbose</tt>,
    # <tt>:msgpack</tt>).
    #
    # Use opts to register custom write handlers, associating each one
    # with its type.
    #
    # @example
    #   json_writer                 = Transit::Writer.new(:json, io)

    #   msgpack_writer              = Transit::Writer.new(:msgpack, io)
    #   writer_with_custom_handlers = Transit::Writer.new(:json, io,
    #     :handlers => {Point => PointWriteHandler})

    # @see Transit::WriteHandlers
